title: Avoiding tickets with Pipedream
published: false

I grew up in Oklahoma City. In OKC, you drive everywhere. Public transporation is lacking and [it's a _huge_ city](https://www.google.com/search?q=okc+square+miles&oq=okc+square+miles&aqs=chrome.0.0i457j69i57.2618j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) - over 100 square miles bigger than Los Angeles.

Ten years ago, I moved to San Francisco, and I drove nowhere. Public transport is plentiful, and my car sat on the street as I biked to work. But the Public Works department [cleans most streets on a schedule](https://www.sfpublicworks.org/services/mechanical-street-sweeping-and-street-cleaning-schedule), and if you don't move your car before cleaning begins, they give you a ticket. The schedule varies from street to street - one block might be Mondays, another Wednesdays - and I would always forget to move my car at the right time. Since I rarely drove it anyway, I ended up selling it.

Fast forward to the present. My wife and I have a child:

And we bought a new car to take him on hikes. The memories of those tickets rushed back. I wasn't going to let the Public Works department win. I needed something to remind me to move my car at the right time, no matter where I parked. I needed a way to turn this:

into this:

I used [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com) to automate this, with help from a handful of APIs. The finished product wasn't at all what I envisioned, and I learned a few important lessons along the way. I thought it'd be fun to talk through that journey.

## What I tried first

I'll spare y'all the details of my many failed attempts. **In short, the real world produces messy data**.

"Clean" data is perfect in every way. Every observation includes all the right fields. Values are never missing, and always recordeded accurately.

Even when software produces data (like web server logs), it's never clean. Fields might be missing for a specific row, large values might get truncated, and the program that logs the data will inevitably encounter a bug that records incorrect values.

Data generated by humans is even messier. Here, my data were street cleaning signs — specifically, their text. I took pictures of sample signs and extracted that text using [Google Cloud's Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/ocr). Then, I was able to parse that text to get the day and time of the cleaning, creating a Google Calendar reminder. I thought I had a solution, but I'd forgotten that data are messy.

I found this sign:

and this one:

Clearly, I couldn't rely on reading the text of every street cleaning sign. I needed a different approach.

## San Francisco Open Data to the rescue

San Francisco operates an amazing "open data" portal, [DataSF](https://datasf.org/opendata/). The [DataSF team](https://datasf.org/about/#who-we-are) helps source data from various city departments and aggregates it into a single platform. Thanks to their many years of effort, you can download [COVID-19](https://data.sfgov.org/browse?category=COVID-19) stats, [311 calls](https://data.sfgov.org/City-Infrastructure/311-Cases/vw6y-z8j6), a [map of every tree maintained by the Public Works Department](https://data.sfgov.org/City-Infrastructure/Street-Tree-List/tkzw-k3nq), and hundreds more. All the data are accessible via API.

I'd used DataSF for many past projects, so I figured I'd search their portal for "street cleaning". Got it. They provide [the street cleaning schedule for all city streets](https://data.sfgov.org/City-Infrastructure/Street-Sweeping-Schedule/yhqp-riqs). Amazing!

## What is Pipedream?

[Pipedream](https://pipedream.com) is an integration platform for developers. You can use it to run **workflows** - just a set of steps that compose an automation. You can run workflows on HTTP requests, emails, on a schedule, or in response to app-based events like new tweets, new files uploaded to Google Drive, and more.

Within a workflow, you can connect to [300+ apps](https://docs.pipedream.com/apps/all-apps/), using pre-built actions that perform common operations, like creating a new calendar event, or sending an email. You can also write [any Node.js code](https://docs.pipedream.com/workflows/steps/code/) - this is where Pipedream shines.
